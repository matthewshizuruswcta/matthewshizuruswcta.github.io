    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>The construction project allowed me to understand the Articles of Confederation and the debate critiqued the articles. Being the judge of the debate I heard from both sides which simulated the arguments of the Constitutional Convention.</p>
    <h2>Relation to 21st Century</h2>
    <p>This is important to know about because this is how our government was made. The Articles of Confederation sparked a conflict between two sides and after the two sides argued, they created a solution. The solution was the Constitution which is still relevant to our government today.</p>

    <h2>Analyzing the Articles of Confederation</h2>
    <h3>1.7 Students will evaluate the unique features of the U.S. Constitution to include the checks and balances between the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches and article five by utilizing one of the big 11 social studies skills.</h3>

    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>By using text reading strategies and responding to historical text I was able to evaluate the checks and balances between the branches of government. I was also able to learn about all the different articles and the balance that the founding fathers created between the government.</p>
    <h2>Relation to 21st Century</h2>
    <p>This is also important because it shows how the government was balanced. Not many Americans know the three branches of government and or what the government really is. Being able to understand each branch and what it does makes me more aware to several problems occurring in our country. It makes me, an American citizen, aware of what is going on in the country that I live in.</p>
