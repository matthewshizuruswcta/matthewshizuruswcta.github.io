    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>The outline is about the many interactions between Native Americans and Europeans that caused each side to feel a certain way about the other. The interactions came from a document provided by my teacher, in which we had to use as evidence from the document in the outline. Writing and reading strategies were also used to create the outline and find the evidence needed for the outline.</p>
    <h2>Relation to 21st Century</h2>
    <p>This standard is important to learn about today because it teaches us about why things are the way they are today. Europeans brought disease over to the Native Americans land which ended up killing the Native Americans. The Europeans also brought their culture and forced it on the Native Americans. This is one of the main reasons why many people are some form of religion related to Christianity.</p>
