    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>This populist reading related to both standards above. In the document we analyzed a piece of historical text and then used our writing skills to answer the questions regarding the movement. I was able to look at what the populist movement was about and what they wanted to change. The questions required us to look at economic, social, and political problems that caused the populist movement to occur. The movement impacted the unfair and corrupted government that was only in favor of factories and companies.</p>
    <h2>Relation to 21st Century</h2>
    <p>Learning about the populist movement and its impact on the economy, social issues, and political corruption is important because these problems still occur today. Many people feel the government is corrupted and controlling. There are still many arguments between political figures that seem like they will not ever be resolved. Society has issues as well that are between the people of the United States. Learning about their tactics in this populist movement could help inspire us to try and compromise the problems that still occur in society today.</p>
