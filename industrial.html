    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>This essay was written on the most important invention,in my opininon, created during the Industrial Revolution. Using my research on the the lightbulb, I was able to argue why the lightbulb was the most important invention by speaking on its effects to the economy and society. 
       I also used my writing strategies to assess the major impact the lightbulb had in advancing technology and urbanization.</p>
    <h2>Relation to 21st Century</h2>
    <p>This standard is important to us today because it helps us understand how urbanization occurred due to the Industrial Revolution. Understanding what each of these inventions did and caused not only informs us on their development, but also how they impacted our technology and development as a country today.</p>

    <h2>Cotton Gin Presentation Script</h2>
    <h3>2.7 Students will describe key people involved in the expansion of African American rights during the late 19th and early 20th centuries by utilizing one of the big 11 social studies skills.</h3>
    <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QsvMttEcL1vXzZsXLESmUGo8pmIL5g4-9V89BJaKEqo/pub?embedded=true"></iframe>
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>This presentation talked about the creation of the cotton gin which increased slavery in America. Even though this caused an increase in slavery, it would lead people to a push for African American rights and stopping slavery overall. This invention only fueled the fire to abolish slavery and was a reason African American rights expanded during the 19th and 20th century.</p>
    <h2>Relation to 21st Century</h2>
    <p>Without people pushing to expand African American rights our country would not be as diverse as it is today. Learning about the oppression of these people teaches us what they were fighting for during that time period. It is a reminder to carry on the legacy of those who fought for equality of all races and to maintain the peace between each other.</p>

    <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k89Onhx_jBaT_Ovnyg0YzbdPkJIAO7oroxjuR9UEmJE/pub?embedded=true"></iframe>
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>Although the cotton gin increased slavery, it did boost the economy and helped America produce more cotton than ever before. By utilizing technology I was able to conduct research and find how the cotton gin effected America overall. This invention allowed us to produce two-thirds of the worlds cotton which ultimately led to a increase in the economy from the exports.</p>
    <h2>Relation to 21st Century</h2>
    <p>By evaluating the contributions of inventors and their inventions it informs us on how their inventions influenced the economy, social, and political state today. Each invention led to something whether it was pushing to abolish slavery, develop technology, and or fixing work areas. All of these inventions have had some significance to how we live today and most of the inventions are still around today in some form or another.</p>
